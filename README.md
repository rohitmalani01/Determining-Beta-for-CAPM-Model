The successful calibration of an optimal risky portfolio for a risk averse client was performed as part of the machine learning exercise. The dataset provided had 23 funds in total that reported their fund Net Asset Value (NAV) monthly. Using critical measures like Sharpe Ratio and Correlation Matrix, we were able to timely assess the relevance and importance of funds in the portfolio. The entire process of optimization was run twice to remove any funds with insignificant weightages as their inclusion would virtually hold no importance. With 8 final funds in the portfolio, a reasonably well diversified optimal portfolio has been constructed for the clients.
